## Introduction

This repository documents my learning journey in the "React - The Complete Guide 2023 (incl. React Router & Redux)" bootcamp by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. Throughout this course, I explored the world of React, mastering the framework and building exciting projects along the way. This documentation provides an overview of the course content and the mini projects I completed during the bootcamp.

## Course Overview

### React Basics & Working with Components

- **Description**: The course kicked off with a deep dive into React's fundamentals, including JSX syntax, components, and props. I learned how to structure React applications.

### React State & Working with Events

- **Description**: I explored React's state management system, understanding how to set, update, and access state variables. Working with events allowed me to create dynamic and interactive components.

### Rendering Lists & Conditional Content

- **Description**: I gained insights into rendering lists of data and handling conditional rendering in React components. This knowledge was crucial for building dynamic applications.

### Styling React Components

- **Description**: Styling React components was made easy with CSS modules and styled-components. I learned various techniques to make my applications visually appealing.

### Debugging React Apps

- **Description**: Debugging is an essential skill for any developer. I learned how to effectively debug React applications and identify and fix common issues.

### Advanced Side Effects Using Redux (Beginner to Advanced)

- **Description**: The course covered Redux, a state management library for React. I started with the basics and progressed to advanced topics like middleware and asynchronous actions.

### React Behind the Scenes

- **Description**: Understanding the internal workings of React, such as the virtual DOM and component lifecycle, helped me optimize my applications for performance.

### Sending HTTP Requests

- **Description**: I learned how to make HTTP requests from React applications, fetching and displaying data from external APIs.

### Building Custom Hooks

- **Description**: Custom hooks allowed me to reuse logic across multiple components. I created custom hooks for managing state and side effects.

### Working with Forms & User Input

- **Description**: Handling forms and user input was a key part of the course. I learned to manage form state, validate input, and create controlled components.

### Adding Authentication to React Apps

- **Description**: I implemented user authentication in React apps, enabling users to sign up, log in, and access protected routes.

### Deploying React Apps

- **Description**: Deploying React applications to platforms like Netlify and Vercel was covered, making my projects accessible to the world.

### React Query / Tanstack Query

- **Description**: I explored React Query, a library for managing and synchronizing data between the client and server efficiently.

### Next.js

- **Description**: Next.js, a popular React framework, was introduced. I learned about server-side rendering, routing, and building full-stack applications.

### Animating React Apps

- **Description**: Animation is a powerful tool for creating engaging user interfaces. I added animations to my React applications using libraries like Framer Motion.

### Testing React Apps (Unit Tests Using Jest)

- **Description**: The course included unit testing with Jest, ensuring the reliability and quality of my React applications.

## Mini Projects

### 1. Meme Generator

- **Description**: I created a meme generator application where users could add text to popular meme templates. This project reinforced my understanding of React's component structure and user interactions.

### 2. Food Ordering App

- **Description**: Building a food

 ordering app allowed me to work with complex state management and user authentication. Users could browse menus, customize orders, and place them securely.

### 3. Expense App

- **Description**: The expense app helped me practice form handling and user input validation. Users could add, categorize, and track their expenses, providing valuable insights into managing state.

### 4. Investment Calculator

- **Description**: This project involved developing an investment calculator that allowed users to calculate returns on their investments. I gained experience in performing calculations and displaying results dynamically.

### 5. Counting App

- **Description**: The counting app was a simple yet effective way to practice state management and event handling. Users could increment or decrement a counter value.

### 6. Adding User and User Authentication

- **Description**: I enhanced my authentication skills by adding user registration and login functionality to my projects. This was a critical step towards building secure and user-friendly applications.

## Conclusion

My journey through the bootcamp was an incredible learning experience. I not only mastered React but also gained practical experience by building mini-projects that apply the concepts I learned. I'm excited to continue exploring the world of React and look forward to taking on more challenging projects in the future.
